# Port_scanner

## Description

This project is a port scanner implemented in [Python]. It allows you to scan a network or a specific host for open ports and perform vulnerability scans using various tools.

## Features

- Scan a network range or a specific host for active hosts and display their IP and MAC addresses.
- Perform a vulnerability scan on each active host using Nmap and display the results.
- Scan a specific host for open ports and display information about each port, including the service and version.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   bash
   git clone git@github.com:devPentest/Port_scanner.git
   ```

## Using

To use the Port Scanner, follow the instructions below:
1 Clone the repository:

# Launch
`python3 main.py example.com` `python3 main.py example.com -p 21,22,23,80,443`

# If using Node.js
`npm install`

4 Run the port scanner:
# If using Python
`python3 port_scanner.py`

# If using Node.js
`node port_scanner.js`

5 Follow the prompts or adjust the script parameters to specify the desired network range or host to scan.
6 The port scanner will display the results of the network scan, active hosts, open ports, and any detected vulnerabilities.

## Please use this program responsibly and for educational purposes only. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to scan networks or hosts. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.
